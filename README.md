Stand Stijl

Stand Stijl is a text toy inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian. It lets you move text around generative grids of rectangles using OSC, and has a few different color&draw modes.

You'll need the [oscP5 library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/).

Custom Max Externals are also included in this release. If you're a Max user, this makes using Stand Stijl extremely easy.

This is rough&quick code that I wrote a few years back when I was learning to program. I figure others might like to tinker with it, just be warned that my design is from when I was starting and is kind of clumsy.
